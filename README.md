# Ciphers and Encryption

A small collection of simple cipher and text-processing scripts.

## Files

- `cipher.py` — Performs a Caesar cipher shift on uppercase letters using a numeric key supplied by the user.
- `crack cipher.py` — Tries all 26 Caesar shifts on input text and prints each candidate plaintext to help crack a cipher.
- `chart.py` — Counts letter frequency in input text and prints a simple histogram using `|` characters.
- `Csquare.py` — Displays characters in a columnar/square transposition based on a numeric size, printing the reordered output.
- `pig latin.py` — Converts input text to Pig Latin (adds `way` for words starting with a vowel; otherwise moves leading consonants to the end).
- `vernam cipher.py` — Demonstrates a Vernam/One-Time Pad style cipher using Baudot codes with functions to generate a random key, encode/decode, and XOR bit-strings.
